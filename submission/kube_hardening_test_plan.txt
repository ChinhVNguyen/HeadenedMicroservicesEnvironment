How will you test the changes?
A sandbox environment will be used to test changes to the cluster. This will protect production systems from being interrupted or corrupted. This is a best practice that we can implement as part of our deployment strategy and Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
Using our sandbox environment, we will test changes to observe and monitor their impact. Once changes are deployed to the sandbox environment, we can monitor metrics using Prometheus and Grafana. Additionally, we can collect logs and traces to identify the root cause of any issues and troubleshoot more efficiently.
Historical observability, in the form of a changelog, will be used to maintain a continuous record of changes. This allows us not only to understand historical events but also to trace how past changes impact the current state of our cluster.
Our overall focus will be on the state of the cluster as a whole, rather than individual components in isolation, to gain a comprehensive overview of the system.
