1. Incident Commander Name: 
Suspicious CPU activity resulting from a cryptomining attack.

2. Executive Summary of What Happened: 
Three pods running different crypto miners were identified, using moneropool, minergate, and cryptonight containers. 
An attacker gained control of the cluster and exploited its compute resources for crypto-mining. 
The Falco monitoring runtime detected the incident, and the administrator was able to visualize the suspicious activity in Grafana.

3. Summary of What Was Affected: 

CPU resources experienced a significant spike, indicating that attackers were using the compute resources for malicious activities.

4. Summary of the Impact: 
Monitoring reports indicated CPU utilization spikes due to the cryptomining attack.

5. Summary of the Remediation Steps:
Kill the affected pods using the command:
kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force
Verify that CPU activity has stabilized.

6.Summary of Lessons Learned:
Review access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and Grafana dashboards to limit potential exposure.
Configure admission controllers to prevent the use of unknown images when creating containers.
Update the priority of Falco rules for the metrics endpoint to the highest level to ensure early detection of suspicious activity
